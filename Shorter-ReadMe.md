Here’s a **sample shorter `README.md` template** you can adapt for any project.
It follows the style guide I shared earlier and includes placeholders for **intro, features, setup, usage, screenshots, and contribution**.

```markdown
# 🔧 Project Name

> One-liner about your project.  
> _(Example: "A CLI tool to quickly format JSON files.")_

---

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
cd project-name

# Install
npm install

# Run
npm start
```

---

## ✨ Features

* ⚡ Fast and simple
* 🛠️ Easy setup
* 📦 Lightweight

👉 So now you have:  
- **Helper Guide.md** → Explains how to format + style markdown  
- **Full README.md Template** → For professional projects  
- **Minimal README.md Template** → For quick/utility projects  

Would you like me to **bundle all three into a single `helper-pack.md`** so you can just copy-paste everything at once?
